Cinna UI is a component library for Tailwind CSS, you just need to copy the code and paste it into your project, and you will have a beautiful website.

## Why Cinna UI?

I created Cinna UI because I wanted to have a component library for Tailwind CSS, and I didn't find any that I liked, so I decided to create my own. I hope you like it.
